# Categorical Decision Tree

The purpose of this package is to provide easy to use decision tree models which:
  * are fully compatible with pandas and scikit-learn
  * work equally well with categorical and numerical data "out-of-the-box"

I am currently working on implementing the following models for classification:
  * C4.5 decision tree
  * CHAID decision tree

Work in Progress...
